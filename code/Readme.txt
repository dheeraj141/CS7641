how to run the code 

prepare_dataset.py is the main file for dataset 1 and data_set1.py is the main file for dataset 2.

in the files in the main functions there are calls to the respective classifiers and are commented to run just uncomment the code and run the file.

please check the path of the dataset if the code is having issue in running.


go to the main function in each file and uncomment the function you want to run.
The code is built using python 3.7 and uses sklearn , numpy , pandas.


rest files are classifier.py which contains the implementation of the all the classifier tuned and untuned versions.

graphtools.py is the utility file containing the functions for plotting the curves and the tree data structures and also various curves related to neural networks.


the code and the data set has been uploaded on the github and the link is posted below.
