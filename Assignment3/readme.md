The code is updated on the github and the link is posted below 
https://github.com/dheeraj141/CS7641.git 

the code contains two files clustering and dimnesionality_reduction which contain the codes for the part 1,2 and 3,4,5. 


The clustering.py file implements the clustering algorithms kmeans and em

the dimensionality reduction algorithm implements all the 4 algorithms and helper functions for analysis 

the first data set variable name is X_train1 and y_train1 
the second data set is breast cancer dataset 

the dataset is uploaded to the github check the path before running

the function for the analysis of each data is written uncomment and run to check 

the code requires python3 sklearn , numpy matplotlib , scipy , pandas
