how to run the code 

each problem has its main file with the same name so 4peaks_updated for 4 peaks and similarly for others 

all the function names are appropriate for the work they do 
find_optimal_parameter mimic to find the optimum paramemters for the functions and in each file there is a main function with the same name as the problem which contains all the functions to call.




go to the that function in each file and uncomment the function you want to run.
The code is built using python 3.7 and uses sklearn , numpy , pandas.





the code and the data set has been uploaded on the github and the link is posted below.
